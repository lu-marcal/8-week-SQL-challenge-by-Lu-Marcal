# 8 weeks SQL challenge, by Data with Danny

Hello there! I have gathered all of my solutions to the 8 case studies from the **[#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com)**, which was created by [Data with Danny](https://www.linkedin.com/company/datawithdanny/).

These case studies display my capability to handle different SQL challenges and reveal my skill in writing SQL queries and problem-solving.

I would like to extend my gratitude to Data with Danny for crafting these interesting and thought-provoking SQL case studies.
